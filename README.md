## Development status

_This is a work in progress. It is currently usable for experiments with
coroutines and for learning how coroutines work. It is incomplete, probably
buggy, and not suitable for any production use._

There are subtle bugs or differences related to coroutine support in
various kinds and versions of compilers. This library is currently being
developed using GCC 12.1.0.

## Repository structure

- `doc/` – documentation
- `src/` – source code
- `test/` – test programs

## Build

The library itself is header only.

Build test programs and basic (Markdown) documentation:

    mkdir build

    cmake ..
    cmake --build . -j `nproc`

## [Documentation](html/index.html)

Documentation of Coro is generated by Doxygen from comments in source
